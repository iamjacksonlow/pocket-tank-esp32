/* tank_events.h - moments the tank reports as they happen (2026-09-15).
 *
 * Sounds are feedback, never behavior (docs/AUDIO.md): tank.c emits an
 * event at the instant something audible happens and carries on; whoever
 * registered a listener (the device: the audio port; the sim: SDL audio)
 * turns it into a cue. No listener = nothing happens, so tests and QEMU
 * need not care. Emitting is cheap and synchronous - a listener must only
 * enqueue, never render (the tank task owns the frame rate). */
